# Min-diff-of-array-elements-Brute-Force-vs-Less-Complex

This Program finds two elements with minimum difference in a user given array. The aim of this program was to demonstrate the diffrence in Time Complexity of the same algorithm.<br/>

The first version of the program uses brute force method which uses two for loops for finding minimum difference and its time complexity was __N<sup>2</sup>__.<br/>

The second method which has time complexity of __N*Log<sub>2</sub>N__ first sorts the array, then finds th minumum difference using only one for loop.
